# My-first-project
# I'm able to understand and remember most of the git commands
# Although when I use git status it will constantly tell me 'nothing to commit, working tree clean' which I undertand because I hadn't made any changes but it's frustrating to see
# I wasn't able to merge and pull the request of the main and master branch as they have different commit histories even after following a tutorial
# I plan on trying again once I'm caught up with everything else
